Please create the Ruby API in a **separate project** you may use the below seed data.
The Ruby Project should consist of a database containing tea products and the above endpoints.
The API base url should be `http://localhost:3000` 

In addition to the API please complete the following files:
- `src/teas/teas.html`
- `src/teas/teas.js`

`/teas` should render the teas from `/teas` endpoint.
the rendered teas should be filtered by (client or server filter is your choice): 
- free text
- type

order by:
- name
- price asc/desc

render the teas in 2 options:
- table
- grid (of cards like in the main route `/`)
